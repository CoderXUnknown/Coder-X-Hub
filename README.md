# Coder-X-Hub

A personal portfolio website representing the professional identity and creative work of its author.

This repository contains the full implementation of a personal web portfolio designed to showcase accomplishments, skills, projects, and background through a custom online presence. Built using modern front-end technologies, the site emphasizes clean design, responsive layout, and a tailored user experience.

The purpose of this project is to provide a centralized digital platform that reflects the author’s expertise and personality. It is structured for deployment on static hosting platforms such as GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify, or any supported web host.

This portfolio serves both as an individual professional showcase and as a demonstration of front-end development capabilities. It is suitable for personal branding, career presentation, and continuous creative evolution.
